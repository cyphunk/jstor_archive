Found it dificult to find scripts that help archive JSTOR content. This is
suprising considering their sorid history in relation to Aarron Swartz.

These scripts do not download PDF content of priviledged JSTOR users. For
that look elsewhere. Instead these scripts allow for archiving of articles
provided freely on a limited bases to public unpriviledged users.
The shell script simply monitors your browser cache and copies gif's
that match the JSTOR preview size (configurable) to a directory and then
generates a pdf and html index when interrupted. The included javascript
user script can be loaded in the browser (via greasemonkey or other user
script management extensions) and will emulate a click on the "next"
button of a JSTOR article so as to fillup the browser cache with the
aticles contents.
